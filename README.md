***OR*** download straight from the latest release.


If you've downloaded an older version before, I recommend deleting "imgui.ini" and "config.ini" in order to reset the UI to the default options.

# Examples

There are lots of examples in the "examples/" folder.

# Usage

### Windows
Run *GUI.exe* file, and the rest is pretty self explanatory.

OR if you want to open a file straight away:
- Using commandline: ./GUI.exe [filename]
- OR Drag and drop the file to *GUI.exe*

### Linux
- chmod +x GUI
- ./GUI [filename]
