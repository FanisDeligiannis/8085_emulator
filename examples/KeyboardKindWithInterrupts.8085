; This program reads from the keyboard ONLY when a button is pressed
; Using interrupt RST5.5.

; When a button is pressed, RST5.5 is triggered.
; By enabling that interrupt, you can read the keyboard only when
; needed, without affecting the flow of your program otherwise

ORG RST55 ; This is where the program counter goes when RST55 happens
	JMP RST55_ROUTINE ; We just JMP to our routine
	
	
ORG CODE

EI ; Enable interrupts

MVI A,00001110B ; Enable interrupt RST5.5 by unmasking it

SIM

MVI A, 00H

LOOP:
	INR A ; Just to confirm we're not hanging
	
	JMP LOOP ; continue forever

RST55_ROUTINE:
	PUSH PSW ; We don't want to change register A
	
	CALL KIND ; Read what was pressed
	
	OUT 30H ; Show it on LEDs
	
	POP PSW ; Get back our PSW
